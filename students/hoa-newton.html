<p class="self">
	My name is Hoa Newton. I came to the US in Dec 2010 from Vietnam. Vietnam is a tiny but beautiful and peaceful country in South East Asia. When I first landed in the US I felt like I was on another planet. I used to miss home very much. However, I am going to make the US my new home even though it is not easy for me to survive during long and depressing winters. I do not want to go out much when it is below freezing. On the other hand, I am falling in love with walking around the park in the summer, under the arches of blossoms, eating ice-cream and listening to music playing on the street. 
	I love to cook. Sewing is also my favorite. I like Korean BBQ so I make it very often. I can also cook Vietnamese noodle soup which is a very popular dish. If you feel like interested in getting some Vietnamese dish recipes, I am very happy to share.
	I am working hard to achive success and  to set my professional career path in the US. I hope I can do well at this class to go further in web development.
