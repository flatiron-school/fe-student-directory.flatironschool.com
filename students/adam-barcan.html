<section>
<p class = "first">I am a 9-5 data analyst and a <a href="http://www.barcanshoot.com" target = “_blank”>freelance photographer</a> living in Brooklyn Heights.
Most weekends, I can be found shooting photos or coaching a local running team, New York Harriers.  Well actually for the next several weekends I can be found watching front-end web dev videos.

I got curious about coding last year; hope this class gets me started on a transition to web development. You only get so far on Code Academy. Thanks for checking out my profile.  See more at <a href="https://github.com/Adam262">Github.</a> </p>
