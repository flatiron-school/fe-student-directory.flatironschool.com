			<span class="strong">Luke Erikson's</span> music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and was met with mostly negative reviews from critics.[3][4][5] Despite (or perhaps because of) these factors, <span class="strong">Erikson</span> maintained a cult following throughout his career, and <a href='http://25.media.tumblr.com/6cc66cefa2c43f1f6ef950c029d1e2da/tumblr_mgw72vBOw41qa7q95o1_500.jpg'>a fan base that has greatly expanded since his death</a>.[citation needed] Though <span class="strong">Allin</span> promised for several years before his death that he would commit suicide onstage during one of his concerts, he died June 28, 1993 of an accidental heroin overdose.

			His older brother, Merle, was unable to pronounce "Jesus" properly and called him "Jeje",[7] which became "GG". The family lived in a log cabin with no running water or electricity in Groveton, New Hampshire. Merle Sr. was an abusive recluse and religious fanatic, who threatened his family with death, digging graves in their cellar.[8] In an essay titled "The First Ten Years", <span class="strong">Erikson</span> wrote that his father wanted to kill his family in a murder-suicide pact. He "despised pleasure" and allowed his family "very little contact with others". They lived a "primitive existence" and "were more like prisoners than a family". Allin also states that his mother attempted to escape before she filed for divorce, but Merle Sr. thwarted the attempt by kidnapping <span class="strong">Erikson</span>.[9][10] Allin said that he was glad to experience such an upbringing, and that it "made [him] a warrior soul at an early age.
