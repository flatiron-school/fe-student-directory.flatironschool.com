		<h2 class="Heading">Biography</h2>
		<p class="Text">Sebastian graduated with a major in Biology and a minor in Fine Art. He attended the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in New York City. After three years, he realized being a doctor was not for him. Since then he has pursued careers in art, education, and business. Throughout this period of self-exploration, he has found that he is a consummate entrepreneur and as a result finds himself at a rapidly growing tech company.</p>

		<h2 class="Heading">Interests</h2>
		<p class="Text">Sebastian's passions are for anything and everything related to nerd culture. He loves video games, fantasy, sci-fi, comics, etc. He hopes to one day integrate these interests into his work.</p>
